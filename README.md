# ✍️ Signature Detection
Detects signature copied is false or real as the exact copy that is given as input
## 🧠 Overview

The **Signature Forgery Detection App** is a powerful AI-based tool that helps verify the authenticity of handwritten signatures using image processing and machine learning. This application is especially useful for banks, educational institutions, legal bodies, and document verification services, offering an automated and reliable way to detect forgeries in real-time.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📤 Upload and compare signature images
- ✅ Detects whether a signature is **genuine** or **forged**
- 📊 Displays a **similarity score**
- 🧠 Uses deep learning (CNNs or Siamese Networks)
- 💻 Web-based interface for ease of use
- 🗃️ Trained on real signature datasets (e.g., CEDAR)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads two signature images – one reference and one test.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are converted to grayscale, resized, and normalized.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) extract key features.
4. **Comparison**: A Siamese Network or feature-based algorithm compares the signatures.
5. **Prediction**: Model returns a similarity score and verdict (Genuine or Forged).

## 🗂️ Dataset Preparation

To train the model, you need a dataset containing **genuine** and **forged** signatures.

### 🔸 Dataset Used

- **CEDAR Signature Dataset**  
  [Download Link](http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/NIJ/data/signatures/)

Each folder should contain `.png` or `.jpg` signature images.
